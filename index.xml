      <description>Overall Architecture We used the sample project’s architecture as a guideline, though we started with an empty Android Studio project. We decided to split views and activities within the presentation folder to ease readability.
What went right Team members who struggled with issues and stories were transparent and asked for help which kept us from being stuck for a long time without making progress. We were able to complete all the user stories without delay for all three iterations.</description>

      <description>Vision Statement The Student Aid Application System is a mobile application aimed to help students with their learning. The system will allow students to create notes, flashcards, and an agenda for themselves to promote the convenience of electronic-based notes and increase the efficiency of a students ability to study and manage their time.
The system will be implemented as a mobile application to target smartphones as it allows the notes to be conveniently accessible within the users’ reach.</description>
