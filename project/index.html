    <h2 id="vision-statement">Vision Statement</h2>
<p>The Student Aid Application System is a mobile application aimed to help students with their learning. The system will allow students to create notes, flashcards, and an agenda for themselves to promote the convenience of electronic-based notes and increase the efficiency of a students ability to study and manage their time.</p>
<p>The system will be implemented as a mobile application to target smartphones as it allows the notes to be conveniently accessible within the users’ reach. Due to this, the system will help the users improve their learning efficiency as it can be used anywhere and anytime.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="description-of-intended-users">Description of Intended Users</h2>
<p>The system will be mainly used by students in high-school and post-secondary education as well as professionals. Since this is a mobile application, the barrier of entry to use the application is low as many people have their own smartphones.</p>
<p>For students, our aim for the system is to replace paper-based notes with electronic notes, which will help students to easily manage their schedule, access their notes, and study on the go. Also, it will lessen the amount of time the a student has to dedicate on making flashcards as the system already has the feature built in. Moreover, the application can help students to plan ahead, as the system enables them to set reminders in order to always be on time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, professionals like engineers can utilize the system by using it as a note organizing system. Often, engineers are on the go and do not have a pen and paper on hand, so with this application they can instead use their phone to take notes and organize them at the same time.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="overview-of-major-functionality">Overview of Major Functionality</h2>
<p>A sample category is included in order to give the user an example of the capabilities of the application.
From the home page, the user can create new categories which will show up in the list below. You can also access your Agenda that contains every reminder for every category in order the category and reminder was created.
Each category has three types of items and can be edited instead of creating new categories every time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Notes: General purpose notes</li>
<li>Flashcards: Question and (hidden) answers to prepare for your next test</li>
<li>Reminders: Keep track of time-sensitive events and see all your reminders together in the Agenda</li>
</ul>
<p>To make it easier to find an item, the user can sort each list either alphabetically or by creation date.
Edit or delete your items quickly with easy-to-use buttons included when accessing them.
Quiz Me: Flashcards within a category are shuffled and can be answered in quick succession with the Quiz Me feature
Agenda: See all your reminders at once with the Agenda button accessible in the bottom menu</p>

<h2 id="sales-pitch">Sales Pitch</h2>
<p>The system will be a major improvement over the use of tangible materials like pens, papers, and binders which are quite often inaccessible in difficult situations such as in public settings or on the go.</p>
<p>The system will provide better ways of notetaking as users can quickly open the app and add notes compared to its paper-based counterparts since it is almost always convenient for most users to use their mobile devices throughout the day.</p>
<p>Also, it will help save the environment as it prevents the constant use of paper. Not only does it help the environment, it also saves time as the user can make flashcards within the application as well as be able to study it anytime and anywhere. For example, a student can glance over his/her flashcards in a crowded bus while using his/her phone.</p>
<p>The reminder feature will help students better manage important events. As students, important events usually comprised of due dates and test date, having reminders within the study app allow users to manage their time between study and school events easier.</p>
<p>This app is a better alternative to most current study apps in use, since it combines three different study functionalities into a single place. Most study apps only allow one function, so users have to switch between apps to get these tasks done, while our app allows interactions between these functions (making flashcards and editing agenda while viewing or editing notes).</p>
